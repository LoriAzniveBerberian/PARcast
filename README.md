# PARcast: DIY-oceanography system for profiling PAR in kelp forests
Nearshore environments support taxonomically-rich biological assemblages that rely on sufficient solar (and lunar) illumination for critical functions including primary production, diel vertical migration, and the timing of reproduction. Photosynthetically Available Radiation, or PAR, describes the visible light (400–700 nm) that autotrophs use for photosynthesis. Quantifying PAR and its attenuation in aquatic environments is therefore essential for understanding ecological and physiological processes governing productivity and habitat suitability—relevant to species distribution and community structure. We present a prototype DIY-oceanography system, PARcast, supporting PAR profiling of complex nearshore environments where shipborne profilers and autonomous floats are generally not applicable. Although PARcast is designed for manual deployment by a swimmer or diver in kelp forests, its scalable design may extend its utility to a variety of aquatic environments (e.g., coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and inland water bodies) and deployment platforms (e.g., small crafts or piers). The prototype comprises two cosine-corrected quantum sensors (Apogee SQ-500). One sensor is externally mounted on a waterproof acrylic enclosure that contains the electronics and logs Ed(z, PAR), pressure, temperature, and tilt to an onboard microSD card. A second, standalone accessory unit with an identical electronic configuration designed for above-water operation, measures Es(PAR). We evaluate the suitability of PARcast for research and teaching applications and present initial data from cruise deployments associated with, for example, NASA’s Student Airborne Research Program and Plumes and Blooms. Instrument specifications, validation datasets, and results will be shared here for community use and feedback.

## Naming Convention
Notes and comments use `E_s(PAR)` and `E_d(z, PAR)`.

CSV file names:
- surface reference: `E_sPAR_YYYYMMDD_0001.CSV`
- aquatic profiler: `E_dzPAR_YYYYMMDD_0001.CSV`

SD card labels:
- surface reference: `E_SPAR`
- aquatic profiler: `E_DZPAR`

We welcome suggestions, questions, and contributions from the community. If you're using PARcast or thinking about building one, head to the discussion forum to introduce yourself and share ideas:

## For Students and Newcomers
PARcast was developed as a learning project as well as an instrument. The resources below were most useful during the build:

The [`literature/`](literature/) folder contains relevant published work on sensor electronics, instrumentation design, embedded systems radiometry, calibration and validation, and ocean optics.

**Ocean optics:** [Ocean Optics Web Book](https://www.oceanopticsbook.info/) — Curtis Mobley's free online textbook, the best place to start if PAR and irradiance are new to you. Also [IOCCG Reports](https://ioccg.org/what-we-do/ioccg-publications/ioccg-reports/) for protocols and methods.

**Embedded systems:** [Making Embedded Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/making-embedded-systems/9781098151539/) by Elecia White and the [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/) for hands-on tutorials. The [Arduino reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/) and [Teensy documentation](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) were used throughout firmware development.

## Acknowledgments
PARcast's firmware and electronics design were developed iteratively with assistance from Anthropic's [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to explain concepts and debug circuits. The final firmware and test sketches were adapted from example sketches provided by Arduino, Teensy/PJRC, and the maker communities behind each sensor library used in this project.
